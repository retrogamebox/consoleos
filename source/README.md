# Overview
Folder containing the source code for RetroGameBox services and libraries running natively.

# What each folder does

`delta-govenor/` and `safe-unplug` are both detailed in the `services.md` file in the `documentation/` directory.

`minigl/` is a stripped down graphics library (that runs on the V3D cores using the OpenGL ES 1.1 CE drivers) used by natively running services to display graphics in the lightest and most power efficient way possible.
