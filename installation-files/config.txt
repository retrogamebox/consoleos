# Here is a list of all clocks, what they affect, and how important they are:
# 	arm_freq:   Frequency of the CPU core, used quite alot, pretty important
#   sdram_freq: Frequency of the SDRAM, used alot, pretty important
#	core_freq:  Frequency of the VPU cores, not used much, not very important
#   isp_freq:   Frequency of the GPU's ISP block, not used at all, not important at all
# 	v3d_freq:   Frequency of the GPU's 3D block, used alot, very important
# 	h264_freq:  Frequency of the GPU's hardware video block, used quite alot, pretty important
